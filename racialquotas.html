    <H2> What are racial quotas? </H2>
    <P> Race quotas are affirmative actions, applied in order to reduce the economic, social and educational disparities between people of different race ethnicities. These affirmative actions may exist in many different ways, but their mandatory nature is more noticeable in the public sector - such as entering universities, public competitions and banks. </ P>
    <H2> How Do Quotas Work? </H2>
    <P> In order to enjoy quotas, people must sign a term in which they declare themselves black, indigenous or brown, which then will be the documentary guarantee of the use of this affirmative policy. Sometimes, when it comes to public tender for some job, the person can go through an interview. </P>
    <H2> Why are there racial quotas? </H2>
    <P> Some people explain racial quotas through the concept of Aristotelian equity. Aristotle, the Greek philosopher, created a theory which consists in: treating the unequal unequally to promote effective equality. If two people live in unequal situations and compete under the same conditions, in particular inequality will be perpetuated. Affirmative action would be a way to put these people at the same level of competition. </P>
    <B> Black and brown represent 53.6% of the Brazilian population </b> and, even though it is a majority, Is in a minority of spaces considered important, such as business leaders and other positions of social relevance. <B> Only 12% of the black population and 13% of the brown population have higher education </b>. Among whites, the figure is 31%. The difference in the level of schooling is also reflected in income. According to the IBGE's 2015 data, the salary of the black and brown population is 59.2% of the white population. In <b> it is the black woman: her salary is equal to 35% of that of a white man </b>, according to PNAD 2014 data. </P>
    <P> The picture of social inequality between blacks and whites occurs because of this difference in opportunities. This question, however, is historically related to slavery. </P>
