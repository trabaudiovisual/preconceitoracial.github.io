    <p>Black women:
 <P> OBS: "Racism is an ideological phenomenon that manifests itself in different ways and which advocates the hierarchization of groups, attributing to some of them negative social values ​​and meanings that serve as justification for their unequal treatment. Specifically, our societies were structured from the definition of social places for women and for the black population that do not pass through the spaces of power and full citizenship. "
Ana Carolina Querino, Coordinator of Economic Rights of UN Women Brazil and Southern Cone.

  The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics shows that the inequalities among the Brazilian population refer to race and gender issues and thus identify a social hierarchy that places white men on top, followed by white women, black men and black women , Which suffer from double discrimination: race and gender. The black woman remains at the base of this pyramid.

  <P> In many countries, black women appear as the majority of victims in various indicators of human rights violations - and in Brazil it is no different. Data from the Center for Assistance to Women - Ligue 180 for the year 2013 indicate that 59.4% of records of domestic violence service refer to black women. The Women's Dossier 2015, from the Public Security Institute of Rio de Janeiro, points out that 56.8% of the victims of rapes registered in the state in 2014 were black. And 62.2% of the homicides of women victimized black (19.3%) and brown (42.9%).
NOTE: Among the murdered women, more than 60% are black or brown.
The rate of homicide of black women is double the rate of white women, this in the national average, because there are states where the racial inequality is greater. </ P>
