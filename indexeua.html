   <p>Due to the export of African slaves in the period of discovery and colonization of Brazil, the Negro has been taxed as inferior by the Brazilian population for simple prejudice.<br>

<br>Prejudice that prevents the black citizen from playing roles in society, from receiving quality education, from being able to get a job vacancy, which for some ends up resulting in a single end: CRIMINALITY.<br>

<br>The age of the whip is over, but we are whipped every day with unattainable words, looks, gestures, and patterns of beauty, through failed attempts at praise such as "You are a white soul black", "Until You're a handsome black "or" You're lucky you did not pull your father's hair ", we're labeled as dirty and lazy as in the classic phrase" black service "and incredible as it may seem We are compared to animals, yes that same, which we ALL as humans share a common ancestor, I think you already discovered right !? He's the monkey himself. <br>

<br>Unfortunately the prejudice is still very recurrent in the lives of many Brazilians, with this work we want to make you aware and do not reproduce in any way racism, as human beings we can not allow anyone else to suffer simply by the color of their skin.</p>
