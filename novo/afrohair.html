    <center><h1> Racial Prejudice</h1></center>  
  </div>
<P> It was just another common day when a curly flitted between pharmacies looking for their creams. Just one more day looking at the long shelves full of options for curly hair from top to bottom, something that had not been before, with a smile on the face.
    <P> Until a scene caught her eye, she was a small child in front of those huge shelves, which the little "snails" on her head contrasted with the curls of the packaging of the products on the shelf. A smile opened on the part of the first curly when she realized that the girl was looking at the packages curiously. </ P>
   <P> That was until the other two figures arrived. </ P>
   <P> They were accompanying the girl at the pharmacy, one of them a curly-haired teen while another appeared to be her straight-haired grandmother. </ P>
 <P> "These should be for really bad hair," her grandmother would say when reading the packaging label. </ P>
<P> "Hard hair. Bombril hair, "the little girl murmured as her grandmother dragged her to another shelf session. </ P>

   <P> It was just another day that another child was influenced about his hair being the wrong type and that the straight one should be revered. </ P>
   <P> Just one more day that would make the child not look pretty and not accept because his hair is curly. </ P>
<P> A day that would make your child smooth his hair just to fit a pattern, not because he really wants to straighten out </ p>
<P> This has been / is the reality of several curses and curly, even if curly / curly hair has begun to be accepted by society there are still people who insist that this type of hair is bad, it is dry, it is ugly , Is hard, "just walking with hair bound to control this mane," "when are you going to finally straighten that hair?". These people are the same ones who worship straight hair, the standard hair that is beautiful and that all should adhere to, how much society was or was influenced to find. </ P>
<P> The issue is that there is no bad hair or better / more beautiful than the other, there are different types of hair each with its own beauty and they require different care. Ever since we were little, we are influenced to perform chemistry in our hair to turn the volume down or even completely straighten our curls to fit a pattern based on what others think and not because we really wanted to do it by our own will to change. This can be bad for both the health of our hair and our emotional health, leading us not to accept ourselves and low self-esteem for failing to meet the smoothed pattern. </ P>
Many of us grow up carrying this challenge of not accepting and staying relaxed while others decide to go through the hair transition: a process in which we are slowly cutting off the parts of hair with chemistry or even cutting at once (known as big Chop) hair so that it grows back with its natural texture. </ P>
<P> For those who have decided to go through the hair transition: it is not easy. It is a hard process of self acceptance, change, patience, and maturation until the curls grow again and burst our essence and our self-esteem. </ P>
<p>It is not only through the hair transition that we have to go through it, but throughout our life, so we should always think, "You are beautiful the way you are, being white or black, thin or fat, curly or Smooth, no matter what others say, from the moment you love yourself and like you no one can say otherwise. </p>
